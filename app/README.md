# Overload App

Make sure you have installed [https://docs.expo.io/versions/latest/workflow/expo-cli/](Expo CLI) via npm / yarn and that you've logged in with it and/or created an account on Expo.

To run the app in development mode:

```bash
yarn start
```

You should then be able to access the app on the Expo Client app on iOS or Android and debug remotely with HMR and all the goodies on your device in a mobile app experience.
